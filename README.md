The Source Code of the NESticle emulator. Created by Bloodlust Software. It was leaked in 1997 by MindRape.

# History
The NESticle emulator was made by Bloodlus Software which consisted of programmers Icer Addis and his friend Ethan Petty. Later Addis created an emulator called NESticle which its source code was later leaked by Donald Moore (MindRape). in Early 2019 togemet2 released the source code to the public and I decided to put the source code here with togemet2's permission.

## Can it be compiled?
I have no clue, We had several attempts at compiling, We're not even sure if this is a completed version!
